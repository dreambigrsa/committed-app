# Facebook Marketing Campaigns for Committed App

## 🎯 Campaign Strategy Overview

**IMPORTANT: Committed is FIRST a public relationship registry, SECOND a dating platform.**

### Core Hierarchy:
1. **PRIMARY:** Public Relationship Registry (register/search verified relationships)
2. **SECONDARY:** Verified Dating Discovery (for singles, built on the same verification system)

### Key Messaging:
- **For Couples:** "Register your relationship in the public registry"
- **For Singles:** "Check the registry first to see if they're taken, then find verified matches"

These campaigns target two key audiences:
1. **Single people looking for love but scared of being used** → Emphasize: Check registry first, then dating
2. **People already in relationships wanting clarity** → Emphasize: Register in public registry
