## Best Practices for Facebook Posts:

1. **Post Timing**: Best times are 9 AM, 1 PM, and 3 PM (weekdays)
2. **Visual**: Always include an image or video with the post
3. **Engagement**: Ask questions or use call-to-actions
4. **Hashtags**: Use 3-5 relevant hashtags (not too many)
5. **Length**: Keep it under 250 characters for best engagement, or use longer format (1000+ characters) for storytelling
6. **Emojis**: Use sparingly but effectively (2-5 per post)
7. **Link**: Include link in bio or use Facebook's link feature
