## 📱 Detailed Version (If They Ask for More Info)

```
Hey! 👋

Let me explain Committed properly:

🎯 WHAT IT IS:
A relationship verification platform with a public relationship registry. Think of it like a public database of verified relationships.

🔍 THE CORE FEATURE - PUBLIC REGISTRY:
- Anyone can search by name or phone number
- See if someone is in a verified relationship
- Both partners must confirm for it to be registered
- It's searchable by the public

💑 FOR PEOPLE IN RELATIONSHIPS:
- Register your relationship (both partners confirm)
- Get an official relationship certificate (downloadable)
- Your relationship becomes searchable in the public registry
- Instant alerts if your partner tries to register another relationship
- Get clarity: if they won't register, you have your answer

💕 FOR SINGLE PEOPLE:
- Search the registry first to check if someone's taken
- Avoid being the "other person" - know before you date
- Then discover verified matches (dating feature)
- All profiles verified: phone, email, government ID
- No fake profiles, no catfish, no married people on dating

🛡️ VERIFICATION SYSTEM:
Every user is verified with:
- Phone number ✓
- Email address ✓
- Government ID ✓

This means no fake accounts, no catfish, everyone is who they say they are.

💡 THE UNIQUE VALUE:
Most apps are just dating apps. Committed is a RELATIONSHIP REGISTRY first - where relationships are verified and searchable. Then dating discovery for verified singles.

It protects both:
- Couples: Get clarity, make it official, prevent cheating
- Singles: Check if they're taken, date verified people only

## 📱 Conversation Flow (If They Respond)

### If they ask: "How does it work?"

```
Great question! Here's how:

1️⃣ FOR COUPLES:
- One partner registers the relationship
- Partner gets a notification to confirm
- Both confirm = relationship is verified and in the public registry
- Anyone can search and see it's verified
- You get a certificate

2️⃣ FOR SINGLES:
- Search someone's name/phone in the registry
- See if they're in a verified relationship
- If they're single, you can match with them in the dating section
- All matches are verified (phone, email, ID checked)

The registry protects everyone - couples get clarity, singles avoid dating taken people.
```

### If they ask: "Is it safe?"

```
Yes! Very safe:

✅ All profiles verified (phone, email, ID)
✅ No fake accounts possible
✅ Public registry means transparency
✅ Cheating alerts protect relationships
✅ Professional counselors available if needed

It's actually SAFER than regular dating apps because everything is verified and relationships are public knowledge.
```

### If they ask: "What's the difference from other apps?"

```
Key differences:

1. RELATIONSHIP REGISTRY FIRST (not just dating)
   - Other apps: Just dating
   - Committed: Registry of verified relationships + dating

2. PUBLIC & SEARCHABLE
   - Other apps: Private profiles
   - Committed: Relationships are searchable by anyone

3. VERIFICATION REQUIRED
   - Other apps: Optional verification
   - Committed: Phone, email, ID required for everyone

4. CHEATING PROTECTION
   - Other apps: No protection
   - Committed: Instant alerts if partner registers another relationship

It's the only app that's a relationship registry first, dating second.
```

### If they ask: "Is it free?"

```
Yes! The app is free to download and use. 

Basic features:
✅ Register/search relationships (free)
✅ View public registry (free)
✅ Verified dating discovery (free)
✅ Relationship certificates (free)

Some premium features may be available, but core functionality is free.

## 💬 Follow-Up Messages

### After sending the main message:

```

**If they seem interested:**

Awesome! Here's the download link: [YOUR_LINK]

Once you download:

2. Complete ID verification
3. If you're in a relationship: Register it
4. If you're single: Search the registry, then explore matches

Let me know if you need help setting it up! 🚀
```

**If they're skeptical:**
```
I get it - it's a new concept! But think about it:

- How many times have you wondered "are they taken?"
- How many relationships lack clarity?
- How many fake profiles are on dating apps?

Committed solves all of that. The registry is public, so you can check. Relationships are verified, so you know it's real.

Want to see how it works? I can walk you through it! 😊

## 🎯 Key Points to Remember

1. **Always lead with the relationship registry** (it's the primary feature)
2. **Dating is secondary** (mention it as "plus" or "also available")
3. **Emphasize verification** (phone, email, ID - no fake accounts)
4. **Highlight the public search** (anyone can check if someone's taken)
5. **For couples:** Focus on clarity, official registration, cheating protection
6. **For singles:** Focus on checking registry first, then verified dating
7. **Keep it conversational** (WhatsApp is casual, not formal)
8. **Use emojis sparingly** (they help but don't overdo it)
9. **Be ready to answer questions** (have the detailed version ready)
10. **Always end with a call to action** (download link, questions, etc.)
