✨ HERE'S THE UNIQUE PART - OUR VERIFICATION SHOW:
If you register a relationship and your partner isn't on the app yet, WE personally contact them on your behalf. We reach out to them, explain the situation, and give you feedback about where you stand. It's like having a relationship mediator helping you get clarity.

So if you're unsure about your relationship status, we'll help you find out - directly from your partner.

💕 FOR SINGLES:

## 📱 Detailed Version (If They Ask for More Info)

```
Hey! 👋

Let me explain Committed properly:

🎯 WHAT IT IS:
A relationship verification platform with a public relationship registry. Think of it like a public database of verified relationships - PLUS a personal verification service.

🔍 THE CORE FEATURE - PUBLIC REGISTRY:
- Anyone can search by name or phone number
- See if someone is in a verified relationship
- Both partners must confirm for it to be registered
- It's searchable by the public

💑 FOR PEOPLE IN RELATIONSHIPS:

Standard Process:
- Register your relationship (both partners confirm)
- Get an official relationship certificate (downloadable)
- Your relationship becomes searchable in the public registry
- Instant alerts if your partner tries to register another relationship

✨ OUR UNIQUE VERIFICATION SHOW:
Here's what makes us different - if you register a relationship and your partner ISN'T on the app yet, we don't just send them a notification. 

WE PERSONALLY CONTACT THEM:
- We reach out to them directly (phone/email)
- We explain that you've registered the relationship
- We ask them about the relationship status
- We give you honest feedback about where you stand
- It's like having a relationship mediator

This is perfect if:
- You're not sure if you're exclusive
- You want clarity but don't know how to ask
- You need someone to help facilitate the conversation
- You want to know the truth without the awkwardness

We do this manually - it's not automated. Real people helping you get real answers.

💕 FOR SINGLE PEOPLE:
- Search the registry first to check if someone's taken
- Avoid being the "other person" - know before you date
- Then discover verified matches (dating feature)
- All profiles verified: phone, email, government ID
- No fake profiles, no catfish, no married people on dating

🛡️ VERIFICATION SYSTEM:
Every user is verified with:
- Phone number ✓
- Email address ✓
- Government ID ✓

This means no fake accounts, no catfish, everyone is who they say they are.

💡 THE UNIQUE VALUE:
Most apps are just dating apps. Committed is a RELATIONSHIP REGISTRY first - where relationships are verified and searchable. Then dating discovery for verified singles.

PLUS: We offer personal verification services - if your partner isn't on the app, we'll contact them for you and give you feedback. It's like a relationship clarity service.

It protects both:
- Couples: Get clarity, make it official, prevent cheating (with our help if needed)
- Singles: Check if they're taken, date verified people only

Want to try it? I'll send you the download link! 🚀

Any questions?

## 📱 Focus on the Show Feature (If They're Interested in That)

```
Hey! 👋

So you're interested in our verification show feature? Let me explain:

🎬 THE VERIFICATION SHOW:
It's a social media show where we help people get relationship clarity.

HOW IT WORKS:
1. You register a relationship on Committed
2. Your partner isn't on the app yet
3. WE personally contact them (phone/email)
4. We explain: "Hey, [Your Name] registered your relationship on Committed. Can you confirm if you're in a relationship with them?"
5. We get their response
6. We give YOU honest feedback about where you stand

WHY IT'S VALUABLE:
✅ No awkward conversations - we handle it
✅ Get real answers - they're more likely to be honest with us
✅ Clarity without confrontation
✅ You know where you stand
✅ It's featured on our social media (with permission)

EXAMPLE SCENARIOS:
- "Are we exclusive?" → We ask them, you get the answer
- "Do they see this as serious?" → We find out for you
- "Are they seeing other people?" → We get clarity

It's like having a relationship mediator helping you navigate difficult conversations.

The best part? It's all done with respect and professionalism. We're not trying to cause drama - we're helping people get clarity.

## 💬 Conversation Flow (If They Respond)

### If they ask: "How does the show work exactly?"

```
Great question! Here's the process:

1️⃣ YOU register the relationship on Committed
   - You provide your partner's contact info
   - They're not on the app yet

2️⃣ WE contact them personally
   - Phone call or email (your choice)
   - We introduce ourselves and Committed
   - We explain: "[Your Name] registered your relationship. Can you confirm?"

3️⃣ WE get their response
   - They can confirm, deny, or clarify
   - We listen to their side
   - We document everything professionally

4️⃣ WE give YOU feedback
   - Honest, direct feedback
   - "They confirmed" or "They said..." or "They're not sure"
   - You know exactly where you stand

5️⃣ IT'S FEATURED (with permission)
   - We share the story on social media
   - Anonymized (we protect privacy)
   - Helps others going through similar situations

It's all done manually by our team - real people, real conversations, real results.
```

### If they ask: "What if my partner gets upset?"

```
Totally valid concern! Here's how we handle it:

✅ PROFESSIONAL APPROACH:
- We're respectful and non-confrontational
- We explain it's about clarity, not drama
- We frame it positively: "They want to make it official"

✅ THEIR CHOICE:
- They can confirm, deny, or ask for time
- We respect whatever they say
- No pressure, no judgment

✅ PRIVACY PROTECTED:
- We only share on social media with BOTH parties' permission
- Everything is anonymized
- We protect everyone's privacy

✅ IT'S ABOUT CLARITY:
- Most people appreciate knowing where they stand
- It's better than guessing or assuming
- We help facilitate honest conversations

Think of it like a relationship counselor helping you both communicate - but we do the initial outreach.
```

### If they ask: "Is this free?"

```
The app is free to download and use.

The verification show service:
- Basic relationship registration: FREE
- If partner is on app: FREE (they just confirm)
- If partner isn't on app (our show): [YOUR PRICING]

The show is a premium service because:
- It requires manual work from our team
- We personally contact people
- We provide feedback and follow-up
- It's featured on our social media

But the core app features (registry, dating, basic verification) are all free!
```

### If they ask: "What if they lie to you?"

```
Great question! Here's the reality:

✅ WE'RE TRAINED:
- We know how to ask the right questions
- We can tell when someone is being evasive
- We document everything

✅ WE'RE HONEST WITH YOU:
- If they seem unsure, we tell you
- If they're evasive, we tell you
- If they confirm, we tell you
- We give you the full picture, not just what you want to hear

✅ IT'S STILL VALUABLE:
- Even if they lie, you get information
- Their response (or lack of) tells you something
- It's better than not knowing at all

✅ WE FOLLOW UP:
- We can ask clarifying questions
- We can verify details
- We're thorough, not just checking a box

The goal isn't to catch them in a lie - it's to help you get clarity. Sometimes their response (or lack of response) is the answer itself.
```

### If they ask: "Can I see examples?"

```
Absolutely! We feature these on our social media:

📱 WHERE TO SEE IT:
- Instagram: [YOUR_HANDLE]
- TikTok: [YOUR_HANDLE]
- Facebook: [YOUR_PAGE]

🎬 WHAT YOU'LL SEE:
- Anonymized stories
- "John registered with Sarah..."
- "We contacted Sarah..."
- "Sarah's response was..."
- "John now knows where he stands"

It's like a reality show but focused on relationship clarity - helping people get answers they need.

Follow us to see real examples! And if you want to be featured (with permission), just register a relationship where your partner isn't on the app yet.
```

## 📱 Follow-Up Messages

### After sending the main message:

**If no response after 1 hour:**
```
Hey! Just checking if you got my message about Committed? The cool part is our verification show - if your partner isn't on the app, we personally contact them and give you feedback. It's like having a relationship mediator! Let me know if you want the download link! 😊
```

**If they seem interested:**

Awesome! Here's the download link: [YOUR_LINK]

Once you download:
1. Sign up (phone/email verification)
2. Complete ID verification
3. If you're in a relationship: Register it
   - If partner is on app: They confirm
   - If partner isn't on app: We contact them (our show!)
4. If you're single: Search the registry, then explore matches

The verification show is perfect if you want clarity but don't know how to ask. We handle the conversation for you!

Let me know if you need help setting it up! 🚀
```

**If they're skeptical about the show:**
```
I get it - it's a new concept! But think about it:

- How many times have you wanted to ask "what are we?" but didn't know how?
- How many relationships lack clarity because no one wants to have the awkward conversation?
- How many people stay in limbo because they're scared to ask?

Our show solves that. We do the asking for you. We're professional, respectful, and we give you honest feedback.

It's like having a friend who's brave enough to ask the questions you're too scared to ask - but we're trained to do it right.

Want to see how it works? Check our social media for real examples! 😊

## 🎯 Key Points to Remember

4. **Explain it's manual** (real people, not automated)
5. **Highlight the value** (clarity without awkwardness)
6. **Mention social media feature** (it's a show, people can watch)
7. **Keep it conversational** (WhatsApp is casual, not formal)
8. **Use emojis sparingly** (they help but don't overdo it)
9. **Be ready to answer questions** (have the detailed version ready)
10. **Always end with a call to action** (download link, questions, etc.)
